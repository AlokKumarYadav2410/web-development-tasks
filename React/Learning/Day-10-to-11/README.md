# React Day 10 - 11

Learned about React Router for handling routing in React applications. Implemented navigation between different components using `react-router-dom`. Explored concepts such as `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, and `Link` to create a multi-page experience within a single-page application.

## Key Concepts
- **BrowserRouter**: A router component that uses the HTML5 history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
- **Routes**: A container for `Route` elements that renders the first child `Route` that matches the current URL.
- **Route**: Defines a mapping between a URL path and a component to render when that path is accessed.
- **Link**: A component used to create navigational links that allow users to navigate between different routes without reloading the page.
